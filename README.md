# RideSafe
Vision based pre-emptive collision detection system. Built with OpenCV and Python. Able to compute distance between camera lens and a variety of objects such as traffic lights, cars, bicycles, people, fire hydrants, etc. Any object that comes within 10 feet is considered too close. This is the beginning of the project as the goal is to turn this into an IOS app to use as a rearview for bicycles or as an add-on to older models of cars who dont have backup collision detection. <br/>
